"iso standard for artificial intelligence and machine learning"

The primary ISO standards addressing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management system) and ISO/IEC 23053 (AI framework using ML). ISO/IEC 42001 provides a framework for managing AI systems, including risk management and governance, while ISO/IEC 23053 offers a common language and framework for describing ML-based AI systems. [1, 2]  
Here's a more detailed look: 

• ISO/IEC 42001:2023: This standard provides a structured framework for developing and implementing an AI management system (AIMS). It helps organizations establish policies and procedures for sound governance of AI, including risk management and impact assessment. [1, 1, 3, 3]  
• ISO/IEC 23053:2022: This standard focuses on establishing a conceptual framework and shared terminology for describing AI systems that use machine learning. It provides a unified vocabulary and model for ML-based AI systems, aiding in communication and understanding among stakeholders. [2, 2]  
• ISO/IEC 22989:2022: This standard defines AI terminology and concepts, providing a common language for discussing AI. [1, 4, 4, 5, 6]  
• ISO/IEC 23894:2023: This standard offers guidance on AI-related risk management for organizations. [1, 1]  
• ISO/IEC 5338:2023: This standard focuses on AI system lifecycle processes, guiding the development, deployment, and operation of AI systems. [3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]  

These standards, along with others in the ISO/IEC AI series, aim to promote responsible and ethical AI development and implementation by addressing key aspects like governance, risk management, and system lifecycle management. [1, 2, 3]
